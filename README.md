# Code Samples

This repository holds code samples of some of my work. It's intended to be an indicator of my coding style and used as a tool so that you can determine if you'd be happy with me writing your backends or coding your front-ends.

## Samples

I've included samples of React code, Express and Node code, some Sequelize migrations, etc. 
I'll periodically add interesting snippets to this repository over time.

### Sample 1 - Settings Page and Reusable Components
#### About this sample
This is a small sample of two folders with a number of reusable components from a React / Redux project using the [Ducks redux architecture](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be?gi=59ac511d9de5).

While this snippet doesn't dive into Redux, it does show my particular design choices for creating generic reusable components (`/SharedComponents`) and how I structure my pages in React / Redux (`/Settings`).

#### Stack
- React
- Redux
- CSS Modules

### Sample 2 - Job Search Engine and Request Handler
#### About this sample

This sample comes from a large scale Node + Express project. I've included three folders from different modules of the application to show I've designed:

1. Transactional email templating (`/mailer`)
2. Bootstrapping the ORM data models and their relationships (`/models`)
3. API Routes (`/routes`)

#### Stack
- NodeJS
- Express
- Sequelize
- Pug

### Sample 3 - Sequelize Migrations
#### About this sample

This sample comes from a project that uses Sequelize as the ORM. The sample shows how I approach writing database migrations with Sequelize.

#### Stack
- NodeJS
- Sequelize

### Sample 4 - Redis Adapter
#### About this sample

This sample comes from a project that utilizes Redis for JWT authentication and email verification.

#### Stack
- NodeJS
- Express
- Redis
